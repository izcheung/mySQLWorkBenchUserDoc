## Overview of SQL WorkBench User Documentation

This documentation will guide you step-by-step through writing SQL commands using the MySQL WorkBench. 

Our goal for this user guide is to provide you with instructions on how to write the most essential SQL queries so that you know the fundamentals of how to manage your relational database.  We have done that by providing a guide on how to write queries for important relational database management tasks such as:

- Managing a table
- Joining tables into a view
- Creating and dropping a trigger

## How This Guide Was Created
This guide was created by two people with the use of Git, GitHub, and VS Code. We used MkDocs for the layout of the webpage. The material was generated based on what we learned in COMP 2714 Relational Database Systems. For additional material that was not covered in class, we referred to the official MySQL documentation and W3Schools. 

Who Was This Guide Created For
This documentation is intended for users that are looking for a straightforward guide on learning how to manage a relational database using SQL queries. The main audience this guide was written for are:

- Beginner-level developers who needs a step-by-step guide on writing SQL commands.
- Analysts requiring SQL for conducting data processing tasks.

Style Guide
Every task within the documentation begins with a brief overview to give readers the context of the topic before going into the instructions. At the bottom of each section, there is a conclusion to summarize what the section has covered. 

To aid in the readability of this guide, we subdivided each task into subheadings which achieve a subtask. Each step was accompanied by figures to guide the reader in showing what the output should look like. 

Throughout the guide, codeblocks were used to represent code. We added the copy button to enhance the ease of use of this documentation. At certain points, we added admonitions to provided some tips and notes that would be helpful to users without disrupting the reading flow. In cases where our readers get stuck, we have included a troubleshoot section to help reader fix common mistakes. 

Thank you for your interest in our user documentation for writing MySQL queries in MySQL WorkBench. We hope this documentation provided some value to you.
